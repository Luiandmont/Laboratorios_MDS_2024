notas para los quintiles de rendimiento de los estudiantes por nivel educacional de los padres, son similares. Sin embargo, sí se observan patrones de comportamiento diferenciado según la primera de las variables. A medida que el nivel educacional de los padres es más alto, se observa menor dispersión en el rendimiento académico: Mientras en los niveles educativos más bajos (some high school) se observa, en términos relativos, mayor dispersión del rendimiento, en los niveles más altos (bachelor y master), el rendimiento muestra menores grados de dispersión. Y otro patrón que se puede observar en los datos, se relaciona con la dispersión en el rendimiento en los extremos de la escala: En el nivel Bajísimo y Muy alto, se registra más dispersión que la observada en los niveles intermedios de la misma, sobre todo en los niveles educacionales más bajos.

de los padres, se observan diferencias en el rendimiento de los estudiantes según su grupo étnico. Si se toma como referencia la nota 5, se puede apreciar que en el caso del nivel \"school\", en 2 grupos étnicos (B y A) la mediana de rendimiento no supera la nota 5, y en el grupo étnico C, la mediana de rendimiento es igual a 5. Para el caso de los padres con nivel educacional \"college\" se observa un mejor rendimiento en todos los grupos étnicos: Todas las medianas de rendimiento están por sobre la nota 5. La excepción en este nivel es el grupo étnico A, cuya mediana de rendimiento para este nivel educativo de los padres, sigue bajo la nota 5. Para el nivel educacional \"postgraduate\", se observa que los grupos B y E presentan los mejores rendimientos (tienen las medianas más altas), aunque con un alto nivel de variación: el rango intercuartil, representado por la altura de las cajas, en este nivel, aumenta de manera considerable. Ahora, se debe tener en cuenta que la alta variabilidad observada se relaciona con la baja cantidad de estudiantes con padres que cuentan con este nivel educativo. También se puede anotar que recién a este nivel educacional, el grupo A de estudiantes muestra una mejora en el rendimiento académico, pues la mediana de GPA supera la nota 5 de referencia. Se aprecia como patrón que si bien hay un efecto del nivel educacional de los padres en el rendimiento académico de los estudiantes, al interior de estos grupos también se generan diferencias según grupo étnico de pertenencia. En todos los niveles, tiende a mostrar mejor rendimiento relativo, el grupo B, y peor rendimiento, el grupo A.\n","\n","En síntesis, a nivel descriptivo, se observa que nivel educacional de los padres afecta el rendimiento académico de los estudiantes, y que parte de la variación al interior de los grupos formados por los niveles educacionales de los padres, esta asociada al grupo étnico al que pertenecen las familias de los estudiantes. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZNGMKtJ6yGS6"},"source":["**Resultado Esperado de la tabla**\n","\n","|    | race/ethnicity   | simple

Para el caso particular de este trabajo, el inner join arroja los mismos resultados que el left join, pues en ambas tablas hay coincidencias en base a la llave utilizada, razón por la cual se conserva la integralidad de la tabla df_grades.
